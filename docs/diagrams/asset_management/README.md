# Asset-related PlantUML diagrams

These diagrams relate to ongoing Whitehall Asset management work - they are currently a Work In Progess

The eventual goal is for the diagrams to be triaged, and actually useful ones should be embedded in Markdown docs similar to other docs.

Directories here:

- abandoned_diagrams - no longer needed, but kept for reuse
- asset_scenarios - auto-generated object diagrams of detailed scenarios
- sequences - sequence diagrams around various scenarios
- generated_model_diagrams - auto-generated model and relationship diagrams
