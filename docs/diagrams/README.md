# PlantUML Diagrams

These diagrams are generated with [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/).

```
brew update
brew install plantuml
cd docs/diagrams
PLANTUML_LIMIT_SIZE=8192 plantuml *.puml
```

You can also use an IDE plugin, or run a server so you can edit the `.puml` files and the images will be live reloaded. See [the plantuml docs](https://plantuml.com/running) for more.
