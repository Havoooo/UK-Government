# Asset Management documentation

The Whitehall Asset Management team are working to improve asset management in Whitehall - a first step is to document the existing system.

The following areas of Asset Management have been documented so far:

[Existing Asset state change scenarios](existing_asset_state_change_scenarios.md)

[Sequence diagrams relating to asset uploading](asset_sequences.md)

[The Edition Asset Model](edition_asset_model.md) showing classes and relationships relating to editions and their assets
