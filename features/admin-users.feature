Feature: User administration
  As a user
  I want to be able to administer my details in application
  So that I can ensure I am in the right department, etc

  - Users have the ability to edit their own email address, but not their organisation
  - Only GDS editors can change users' organisations
  - GDS editors are able to see a list of users to allow them to easily operate on their records

  Scenario: Logged in writers should see their role
    Given I am a writer
    Then I should see that I am logged in as a "Writer"

  Scenario: Logged in editors should see their role
    Given I am an editor
    Then I should see that I am logged in as a "Departmental Editor"

  Scenario: Logged in GDS editors should see their role
    Given I am a GDS editor
    Then I should see that I am logged in as a "GDS Editor"

  Scenario: Logged in users should be able to view but not edit their record
    Given I am a writer called "John Smith"
    And the organisation "Department of Beards" exists
    When I view my own user record
    Then I can see my user details
    But I cannot change my user details

  Scenario: Logged in users should be able to see other users' contact details
    Given I am a writer
    And there is a user called "John Smith" with email address "johnsmith@example.com"
    When I visit the admin author page for "John Smith"
    Then I should see an email address "johnsmith@example.com"
